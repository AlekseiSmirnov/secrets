[![software by Dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/software_by_dyne.png)](http://www.dyne.org)

FXC is the underlying cryptographic protocol used in [Freecoin](https://github.com/pienews/freecoin). It is used to generate passwords that are split into pieces to be distributed to friends, so that when the password is lost it can be recuperated by putting together the pieces.

The FXC protocol and its use cases are explained in detail in this document [Implementation of digital social currency infrastructure (D5.5)](http://dcentproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/D5.5-Implementation-of-digital-social-currency-infrastructure-.pdf) produced as part of the research conducted in the [D-CENT project](http://dcentproject.eu/resource_category/publications/).
